What Is Plank?

Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet. The goal is to provide
just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more. It is, however, a library
which can be extended to create other dock programs with more advanced features.

(Codenames for releases are currently based on characters of "Ed, Edd n Eddy".)
